# Contributing to Vagrantfile Generator
---
Thank you for interest and willingness to help, but...  

## TLDR
**Just fork it, and have fun.**  
If you really want me to look at it, open an Issue/PR and let's discuss it (if I'll have time).


### Background story
This project has begun as a very rush decision to build GUI for generating Vagrantfiles, because for hundreth time, I needed to quickly spin up test environment. Since I wasn't going to, once again, spend 15 minutes writing Vagrantfile for 3 VMs and 2 networks, I have instead spent 2 weeks building this monstorsity.

This project is my take on `vibe-coding` (this term should be prohibited / forgotten). I don't really have time to properly take care of it. But I enjoy it so far.

There should be a todo / ideas / roadmap page somewhere in the footer, if you are intersted what I still plan to add.
