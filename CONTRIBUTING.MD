# Contributing to Vagrantfile Generator
---
Thank you for interest and willingness to help.
This project is 98% built by LLMs (I wanted it to be 100%, but we are not there yet), and the code looks exactly like that... you've been warned.  

## TLDR
**Just fork it, and have fun.**  
If you really want me to look at it, open an Issue/PR and let's discuss it (I'll try to make time). Let's be honest, I will not spend time going through source code. At best, I'll run through a review agent, and manually test the feature (if I like it in the first place).


### Background story
This project has begun as a very rush decision to build GUI for generating Vagrantfiles, because for hundreth time, I needed to quickly spin up test environment. Since I wasn't going to, once again, spend 15 minutes writing Vagrantfile for 3 VMs and 2 networks, I have instead spent 2 weeks building this monstorsity.


There should be a todo / ideas / roadmap page somewhere in the footer, if you are intersted what I still plan to add.
