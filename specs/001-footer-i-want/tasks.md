# Tasks: Configurable Footer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-footer-i-want/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Frontend component development in `frontend/src/` structure
- Tests in `frontend/tests/` directory

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [X] T001 Create footer directory structure at backend/data/footer/
- [X] T002 [P] Create footer configuration file template at backend/data/footer/footer.md
- [X] T003 [P] Add backend HTTP API routes for footer file discovery and content serving

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [X] T004 [P] Contract test for footer file discovery API in frontend/tests/contract/test_footer_discovery.js
- [X] T005 [P] Contract test for footer content retrieval API in frontend/tests/contract/test_content_retrieval.js
- [X] T006 [P] Integration test for basic footer display in frontend/tests/integration/test_footer_display.js

- [X] T008 [P] Integration test for external link handling in frontend/tests/integration/test_external_links.js
- [X] T009 [P] Integration test for error handling in frontend/tests/integration/test_error_handling.js

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [X] T010 [P] Footer component HTML structure in frontend/src/components/footer.html
- [X] T011 [P] Footer configuration model in frontend/src/js/models/FooterConfiguration.js
- [X] T012 [P] Static page model in frontend/src/js/models/StaticPage.js
- [X] T013 [P] Footer navigation link model in frontend/src/js/models/FooterNavigationLink.js
- [X] T014 Footer service for HTTP API communication in frontend/src/js/services/FooterService.js
- [X] T015 Markdown processing service for backend content in frontend/src/js/services/MarkdownService.js
- [X] T016 Footer Alpine.js component behavior in frontend/src/js/components/FooterComponent.js

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [X] T017 Footer CSS styling with responsive positioning in frontend/src/styles/components/footer.css
- [X] T018 Backend API integration for footer content serving in frontend/src/js/router/StaticPageRouter.js
- [X] T019 Error page component for backend API failures in frontend/src/components/error-page.html
- [X] T020 Include footer component in main layout at frontend/src/index.html
- [X] T021 Backend API endpoint implementation in backend/src/api/footer.py

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [X] T022 [P] Unit tests for footer models in frontend/tests/unit/test_footer_models.js
- [X] T023 [P] Performance optimization for HTTP API calls (<100ms responsive footer rendering)
- [X] T024 [P] Mobile responsive testing and CSS positioning adjustments
- [X] T025 [P] Update documentation in README.md for footer configuration
- [X] T026 Run quickstart.md manual testing scenarios

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before everything else
- Tests (T004-T009) before implementation (T010-T021)
- Models (T011-T013) before services (T014-T015)
- Services (T014-T015) before component behavior (T016)
- Core implementation (T010-T016) before integration (T017-T021)
- Integration complete before polish (T022-T026)

## Parallel Example
```bash
# Launch T004-T009 together (all different test files):
Task: "Contract test for footer file discovery in frontend/tests/contract/test_footer_discovery.js"
Task: "Contract test for markdown content processing in frontend/tests/contract/test_markdown_processing.js"
Task: "Integration test for basic footer display in frontend/tests/integration/test_footer_display.js"
Task: "Integration test for internal page navigation in frontend/tests/integration/test_page_navigation.js"
Task: "Integration test for external link handling in frontend/tests/integration/test_external_links.js"
Task: "Integration test for error handling in frontend/tests/integration/test_error_handling.js"

# Launch T010-T013 together (different component files):
Task: "Footer component HTML structure in frontend/src/components/footer.html"
Task: "Footer configuration model in frontend/src/js/models/FooterConfiguration.js" 
Task: "Static page model in frontend/src/js/models/StaticPage.js"
Task: "Footer navigation link model in frontend/src/js/models/FooterNavigationLink.js"

# Launch T022-T025 together (different polish tasks):
Task: "Unit tests for footer models in frontend/tests/unit/test_footer_models.js"
Task: "Performance optimization for file scanning (<100ms footer rendering)"
Task: "Mobile responsive testing and CSS adjustments"
Task: "Update documentation in README.md for footer configuration"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Verify contract tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow progressive enhancement principles throughout implementation
- Maintain Alpine.js patterns consistent with existing codebase

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - footer-discovery.md → T004 contract test task [P]
   - markdown-processing.md → T005 contract test task [P]
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - FooterConfiguration entity → T011 model creation task [P]
   - StaticPage entity → T012 model creation task [P] 
   - FooterNavigationLink entity → T013 model creation task [P]
   
3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Scenario 1 (Basic Footer Display) → T006 integration test [P]
   - Scenario 2 (Internal Page Navigation) → T007 integration test [P]
   - Scenario 3 (External Link Handling) → T008 integration test [P]
   - Scenario 4 (Error Handling) → T009 integration test [P]

4. **Ordering Logic**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies prevent parallel execution where file conflicts exist

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

### Constitutional Compliance
- [x] **Modular Architecture**: Tasks create self-contained footer component with clear boundaries
- [x] **Dependency Constraint**: No tasks introduce new dependencies (uses existing Alpine.js/Tailwind stack)  
- [x] **Container-First**: T003 ensures container compatibility via bind-mounting
- [x] **Frontend-Backend Separation**: All tasks are frontend-only, no backend modifications
- [x] **Progressive Enhancement**: T017 CSS and T019 error handling provide graceful JavaScript fallbacks

### Task Quality
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T005)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T011-T013)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T009 before T010-T021)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
