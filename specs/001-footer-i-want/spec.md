# Feature Specification: Configurable Footer

**Feature Branch**: `001-footer-i-want`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Footer - I want to add configurable footer to the app. I'd like to add simple footer the site, that can hold links to additional pages (eg. Roadmap, Changelog, etc) and some general info text (eg. Copyright message). Footer should be configurable from a separate .md file. Text in the footer.md (eg. copyright message) will be rendered under the links. Links in the footer are leading to a separate page/view (that preserves/extends the current styling). Data for the new page eg. Roadmap page, should be read from a static .md file. Choose proper location for static pages that will be later bindmounted to the container. Footer should be always visible on the front-page. On other pages, eg. Project Detail page, or Settings, ..., footer should be at the bottom (you have to scroll down to see it). Adding a new .md file should automatically add link to the footer. Top level heading (eg. # Roadmap) in the .md file should be used as name of the link in the footer. If the heading is a link to external site, it should be handled as such."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: When a markdown file has no top-level heading (# title), what should happen to the footer link? ‚Üí A: Use the filename as the link text (remove .md extension)
- Q: How should the system detect if a top-level heading contains an external URL? ‚Üí A: Look for markdown link syntax: `# [Title](http://external.com)`
- Q: What should happen when the footer configuration file is empty or missing? ‚Üí A: Display default text "¬© 2025 Vagrantfile Generator."
- Q: What file naming convention should trigger automatic footer link creation for static pages? ‚Üí A: Dedicated directory (backend/data/footer/) with .md files, ignore files starting with underscore
- Q: What should happen when a static page markdown file is corrupted or has invalid content? ‚Üí A: Create footer link but show error page when clicked

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can view a footer on every page of the application that provides access to additional informational pages (such as Roadmap, Changelog, About) and displays configurable text content (such as copyright information). Users can navigate to these additional pages while maintaining the application's consistent visual styling.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user is on the main application page, **When** they scroll to view the footer, **Then** footer is immediately visible without scrolling
2. **Given** user is on any secondary page (Project Detail, Settings), **When** they scroll to the bottom of the page, **Then** footer is visible at the bottom
3. **Given** footer contains navigation links, **When** user clicks a footer link, **Then** they navigate to the corresponding informational page with consistent styling
4. **Given** a new markdown file is added to the footer directory (not starting with underscore), **When** the application loads, **Then** a new link automatically appears in the footer using the top-level heading as the link text
5. **Given** footer configuration file contains text content, **When** user views the footer, **Then** the text content is displayed below the navigation links
6. **Given** a markdown file contains a top-level heading with markdown link syntax `# [Title](URL)`, **When** user clicks the corresponding footer link, **Then** they are directed to the external URL

### Edge Cases
- How does the footer behave on very small screen sizes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a footer component on every page of the application
- **FR-002**: System MUST position footer as always visible on the front page without scrolling
- **FR-003**: System MUST position footer at the bottom of secondary pages (requiring scroll to view)
- **FR-004**: System MUST read footer text content from a dedicated markdown configuration file, or display default text "¬© 2025 Vagrantfile Generator." if file is empty or missing
- **FR-005**: System MUST display footer text content below navigation links
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically discover static markdown pages in backend data directory (backend/data/footer/) via HTTP API and generate footer navigation links, excluding files starting with underscore
- **FR-007**: System MUST use the top-level heading from each markdown file as the link text in footer, or use filename (without .md extension) if no heading exists
- **FR-008**: System MUST create navigable pages for each static markdown file that preserve application styling
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle external links when top-level heading uses markdown link syntax `# [Title](URL)`
- **FR-010**: System MUST serve static footer files via backend HTTP API from backend/data/footer/ directory
- **FR-011**: System MUST render markdown content into HTML for display on static pages, or display error page for corrupted files

- **FR-012**: System MUST implement responsive design ensuring footer positioning doesn't interfere with main content on any screen size

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Footer Configuration**: Contains customizable text content (copyright, general information) displayed below navigation links, served from backend/data/footer/footer.md
- **Static Page**: Markdown file in backend/data/footer/ directory containing content for informational pages, with top-level heading used for navigation (files starting with underscore are excluded)
- **Footer Navigation Link**: Auto-generated link derived from static page heading, pointing to rendered page or external URL
- **Static Page View**: Rendered page displaying markdown content with consistent application styling

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Constitutional Alignment
- [x] **Modular Architecture First**: Feature specified as self-contained footer component with clear boundaries
- [x] **Dependency Constraint**: No new dependencies required (uses existing markdown processing)
