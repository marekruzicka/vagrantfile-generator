# App Overview

This is a **quick tour** of the app interface.

## Projects list / Frontpage
This is the main projects page where you can create, search and filter your Vagrant projects. Each card shows basic stats (VM count, status) and quick actions.

## Project detail

## Settings
The Settings screens let you manage global resources such as plugins, provisioners, boxes and triggers which can then be assigned to projects.
