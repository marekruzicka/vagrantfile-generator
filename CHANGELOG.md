# Changelog

## Version 1.11.0
**Date:** October 3, 2025

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Bulk Edit ‚Äî add network configuration**: You can now add full network interface configurations when bulk editing VMs. The Bulk Edit modal lets you add private/public networks and port forwarding entries that will be applied to all selected VMs. Supported fields include IP assignment (DHCP or static), IP address, netmask, bridge interface, and host/guest ports for forwarded ports.

### üé® UI / UX Improvements
- **Bulk Edit VMs modal restyle**: Unified the Bulk Edit modal UI with the Bulk Create modal. The modal now uses a white background, a blue info notification showing the number and names of VMs being edited, and VM name badges for clearer context.
- **Network Interface UX parity**: The Bulk Edit network interface form now matches the single-VM creation/edit flows (consistent inputs for private/public network options and port forwarding), including clearer controls for adding/removing interfaces.
- **Form behavior fixes**: Added `novalidate` to forms where necessary and cleaned up stray markup that previously broke modal layouts.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Network interface validation**: Backend/front-end validation was hardened by deleting unused optional fields instead of setting them to null, preventing spurious validation errors for network interface payloads.
- **Bulk Edit reliability**: Fixed remaining Bulk Edit issues ‚Äî box selection now uses a dropdown populated from configured boxes, form validation issues resolved, and markup fixes to ensure the modal renders and submits reliably.

### üîß Technical Notes
- The bulk-edit network feature reuses existing utilities for IP handling. An optional IP incrementing helper is available and used when applying a base static IP across multiple VMs, but the primary new feature is the ability to add network interfaces in bulk ‚Äî IP incrementing is an implementation detail, not the headline feature.

## Version 1.10.3
**Date:** October 3, 2025

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Bulk Edit VMs - Box selection**: Replaced the free-form box input in the Bulk Edit VMs modal with a dropdown menu populated from configured boxes. This fixes cases where bulk edits failed or applied invalid box names; selecting a box now applies the value to all selected VMs.

---

## Version 1.10.2 - Trigger bulk-delete & modal fixes
**Date:** October 3, 2025

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Bulk Delete for Triggers on Project Detail page**: Resolved an issue where the Bulk Delete confirmation modal invoked a non-existent handler, preventing the removal of selected triggers. The modal now calls the existing `bulkDeleteTriggers()` method which removes the selected triggers and refreshes the project view.
- **Fixed Delete Modal Positioning**: The trigger delete / bulk-delete modals opened too high on some viewports. Updated modal markup to use the shared `modal-overlay` / `modal-content` pattern so modals are centered and consistent with other confirmation dialogs.

### üé® UI/UX Improvements
- Standardized bulk-delete modal layout to match other bulk-delete dialogs (plugins/provisioners): improved spacing, iconography and action layout for a clearer confirmation flow.
- Improved user feedback: the UI closes the modal on success and shows a success notification indicating how many triggers were removed.

### üîß Technical Notes
- Files changed (frontend): `frontend/src/modals/bulk-delete-triggers.html`, minor JS wiring to use existing `bulkDeleteTriggers()` method. No backend API changes required.
